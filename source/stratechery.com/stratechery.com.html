		<p>To understand how Google ended up with a €4.3 billion fine and a 
90-day deadline to change its business practices around Android, it is 
critical to keep one date in mind: July 2005.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_0_3598" data-footnote-number="1" data-footnote-identifier="1" alt="See Footnote 1" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;The exact date of the acquisition is unknown &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_0_3598" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_0_3598" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_0_3598" id="identifier_0_3598" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The exact date of the acquisition is unknown">1</a></sup>
 That was when Google acquired a still in-development mobile operating 
system called Android, and to put the acquisition in context, Steve Jobs
 was, <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Steve_Jobs_No_Tablet_No_PDA_No_Cell_Phone_Lots_Of_iPods/">at least publicly</a>,
 “not convinced people want to watch movies on a tiny little screen”. He
 was, of course, referring to the iPod; Apple would go on to release an 
iPod with video playback a few months later, but the iPhone was still a 
year-and-a-half away from being revealed.</p>
<p>In other words, Android, at least at the beginning, wasn’t a response to Apple;<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_1_3598" data-footnote-number="2" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;For those wondering, then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt didn’t join Apple’s Board of Directors until August 2006 &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_1_3598" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_1_3598" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_1_3598" id="identifier_1_3598" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For those wondering, then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt didn’t join Apple’s Board of Directors until August 2006">2</a></sup>
 the real target was Microsoft (and to a lesser extent Blackberry), 
which seemed poised to dominate smartphones just as they had the 
desktop. That was an untenable situation for Google; then Vice-President
 of Product Management Sundar Pichai wrote <a href="https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2009/02/browsers-powered-by-user-choice.html">on the Google Public Policy blog</a> about the company’s challenges on PCs:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Google believes that the browser market is still largely 
uncompetitive, which holds back innovation for users. This is because 
Internet Explorer is tied to Microsoft’s dominant computer operating 
system, giving it an unfair advantage over other browsers. Compare this 
to the mobile market, where Microsoft cannot tie Internet Explorer to a 
dominant operating system, and its browser therefore has a much lower 
usage.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What mattered to Google was access to end users: that is what makes the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation flywheel</a>
 turn. On PCs the company had succeeded through a combination of 
flat-out being better, the fact that it was very simple to visit a new 
URL (and make it your homepage), and deals with OEMs to set Google as 
the homepage from the beginning. All would be more difficult to achieve 
on mobile, at least mobile as it was understood in 2005: applications 
were notoriously difficult to find and install, and Microsoft and 
Blackberry had locked down their operating systems to a much greater 
extent than Microsoft had on the PC.</p>
<p>Thus the Android gambit: Google decided to take on Microsoft directly
 in mobile operating systems, and its most powerful tool would not be 
the quality of the operating system, but the business model. To that 
end, while Google did, naturally, <a href="https://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/10/27/android-before-and-after-the-iphone/">retool Android’s user interface</a>
 once the iPhone was announced, the business model remained Microsoft 
kryptonite: whereas Microsoft charged a per-device licensing fee, just 
as it had with Windows, Android would not only be free and open-source, 
Google would actually share search revenue derived from Android with 
OEMs that installed the operating system.</p>
<p>Of course Android also ended up being a much better experience than 
Windows Mobile in the post-iPhone world, and the deal was irresistible 
to OEMs flailing for a response to the iPhone: get a (somewhat) 
comparable (sort-of) touch-based operating system for free, and even 
make money after the initial sale! Indeed, not only did Android 
effectively kill Microsoft’s mobile efforts, it went on to take over the
 world via a massive ecosystem of device makers and mobile carriers that
 competed to drive down costs and increase distribution.</p>
<h4>Android’s Success</h4>
<p>That Android increases competition was the focus of Pichai’s — now the CEO of Google — <a href="https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/android-has-created-more-choice-not-less/">latest blog post</a> in response to the ruling:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today, the European Commission issued a competition decision against 
Android, and its business model. The decision ignores the fact that 
Android phones compete with iOS phones, something that 89 percent of 
respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed. It also 
misses just how much choice Android provides to thousands of phone 
makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices; 
to millions of app developers around the world who have built their 
businesses with Android; and billions of consumers who can now afford 
and use cutting-edge Android smartphones. Today, because of Android, 
there are more than 24,000 devices, at every price point, from more than
 1,300 different brands…
</p></blockquote>
<p>What Pichai doesn’t say is that this competition is not so much a 
feature as it was the point: open-sourcing Android commoditized 
smartphone development meaning anyone could enter, even as few were in a
 position to profit over time. That included Google, at least at the 
beginning, which was by design: remember, the point of Android was not 
to make money like Windows, it was to stop Windows or any other 
operating system from getting between Google and users. Venture 
capitalist Bill Gurley explained in a 2011 post entitled <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2011/03/24/freight-train-that-is-android/">The Freight Train That Is Android</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Android, as well as Chrome and Chrome OS for that matter, are not 
“products” in the classic business sense. They have no plan to become 
their own “economic castles.” Rather they are very expensive and very 
aggressive “moats,” funded by the height and magnitude of Google’s 
castle [(search advertising)]. Google’s aim is defensive not offensive. 
They are not trying to make a profit on Android or Chrome. They want to 
take any layer that lives between themselves and the consumer and make 
it free (or even less than free). Because these layers are basically 
software products with no variable costs, this is a very viable 
defensive strategy. In essence, they are not just building a moat; 
Google is also scorching the earth for 250 miles around the outside of 
the castle to ensure no one can approach it. And best I can tell, they 
are doing a damn good job of it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed they were, but the strategy had a built-in problem: Android 
was, well, open source, and just as that helped Android spread, it could
 just as easily be forked into an initially compatible operating system 
that didn’t connect to Google’s services — the castle that Google was 
trying to protect all along. Google needed a wall for its moat, and 
found one in the Google Play Store.</p>
<h4>The Google Play Store and Google Play Services</h4>
<p>The Google Play Store, not unlike Android’s user interface, was a 
response to the iPhone, specifically the highly successful launch of the
 App Store in 2008. And while the Play Store often lagged the App Store 
when it came to cutting-edge apps, particularly in the early days, it 
quickly became one of Google’s most valuable services, both in terms of 
making Android useful as well as making Google money.</p>
<p>Note, though, that the Play Store is <em>not</em> a part of Android: 
it has always been closed-source and exclusive to Google’s version of 
Android, just like other Google services like Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. 
The problem Google had with all of those apps, though, was that they 
were updated with the operating system, and OEMs and carriers — who only
 made money when a device was initially sold — were not particularly 
incentivized to update the operating system.</p>
<p>Google’s solution was Google Play Services; first released in 2010 as
 a part of Android 2.2 Froyo, Google Play Services was distributed via 
the Play Store and provided an easily updatable API layer that would, in
 the initial version, allow Google to update its own apps independent of
 operating system updates. It was an elegant solution to a real problem 
inherent in the free-wheeling model Google had taken for Android 
distribution: widespread fragmentation. Soon all of Google’s apps were 
built on top of Google Play Services, and then, in 2012, Google started 
opening it up to developers.</p>
<p>The initial version was quite modest; here is the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/posts/J1A5hc1ZnS1">announcement on Google+</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  At Google I/O we announced a preview of Google Play services, a new 
development platform for developers who want to integrate Google 
services into their apps. Today, we’re kicking off the full launch of 
Google Play services v1.0, which includes Google+ APIs and new OAuth 2.0
 functionality. The rollout will cover all users on Android 2.2+ devices
 running the latest version of the Google Play store.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the next several years, though, Google devoted more and more of 
its effort — and its most interesting APIs, like location and maps and 
gaming services — to Google Play Services; meanwhile, whatever 
equivalent service was in the open-source version of Android was 
effectively frozen in time. The net result is incredibly significant to 
teasing out this case: Google Play Services silently shifted ever more 
apps from Android apps to Google Play apps; today, no Google app will 
function on open-source Android without extensive reworking, and the 
same applies to ever more 3rd-party apps as well.</p>
<p>That noted, it is hard, in my estimation, to see this as being an 
antitrust violation. The fact of the matter is that Google was 
addressing a legitimate problem in the Android ecosystem, and the 
company didn’t make any developer use Google Play Services APIs instead 
of the more basic ones still available even today.</p>
<h4>The European Commission Case</h4>
<p>The European Commission found Google guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illegally tying Google’s search and browser apps to the Google Play 
Store; to get the Google Play Store and thus a full complement of apps, 
OEMs have to pre-install Google search and Chrome and make them 
available within one screen of the home page.</li>
<li>Illegally paying OEMs to exclusively pre-install Google Search on every Android device they made.</li>
<li>Illegally barring OEMs that installed Google’s apps from selling any device that ran an Android fork.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken in isolation, these seem to run from least problematic to most problematic.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Google Play Store has always been an exclusive Google app; it 
seems that Google ought to be able to distribute it exclusively as part 
of a bundle if it so chooses.</li>
<li>Pinning all revenue from Google Search to exclusivity on all devices
 quite obviously makes it very difficult for alternative search services
 to build share (as they lack access to pre-installs, one of the most 
effective channels for customer acquisition); this seems to be more of a
 Google Search dominance issue than an Android dominance issue though.</li>
<li>Predicating the availability of any of Google’s apps, including the Google Play Store, on OEMs <em>not</em>
 taking advantage of the open source nature of Android on devices that 
will not include Google apps seems much more problematic than Google 
insisting its apps be distributed in a bundle. The latter is Google’s 
prerogative; the former is dictating OEM actions just because Google 
can. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is where the history of Android matters; before Google Play 
Services, the primary challenge in building a competitive fork of 
Android would have been convincing developers to upload their apps to a 
new app store (since Google would obviously not want to put its apps, 
including the Play Store, on said fork). That fork, though, never 
materialized because of Google’s contractual terms barring OEMs from 
selling any devices built on such a fork.</p>
<p>Today the situation is very different: that contractual limitation 
could go away tomorrow (or, more accurately, in 90 days), and it 
wouldn’t really matter because, as I explained above, many apps are no 
longer Android apps but are rather Google Play apps. To run on an 
Android fork is by no means impossible, but most would require more 
rework than simply uploading to a new App Store.</p>
<p>In short, in my estimation the real antitrust issue is Google 
contractually foreclosing OEMs from selling devices with non-Google 
versions of Android; the only way to undo that harm in 2018, though, 
would be to make Google Play Services available to any Android fork.</p>
<h4>The Commission’s Remedies</h4>
<p>To be sure, that’s not exactly what the European Commission ordered 
(in fact, “Google Play Services” does not appear a single time in the 
press release); the Commission seems to feel that the three issues do 
stand alone. That means that Google has to respond to each individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google has to untie the Play Store from Search and the Chrome browser</li>
<li>Google has already stopped paying OEMs for portfolio-wide search exclusivity</li>
<li>Google can no longer stop OEMs from selling devices with Android forks</li>
</ul>
<p>The most momentous by far is the first (despite the fact it is the 
weakest allegation, in my estimation). Samsung, or any other OEM, could 
in 90 days sell a device with Bing search only and the Google Play Store
 (where of course Google Search could be downloaded). This will likely 
accrue to consumers’ benefit: Microsoft, Google, and other providers 
will soon be bidding to be the default search option, and, given the 
commoditized nature of Android devices, it is likely that most of what 
they are willing to pay will go towards lower prices.</p>
<p>Still, it is an unsatisfying remedy: Google built Android for the 
express purpose of monetizing search, and to be denied that by 
regulatory edict feels off; Google, though, bears a lot of the blame for
 going too far with its contracts.</p>
<p>More broadly, the European Commission continues to be a bit too 
cavalier about denying companies — well, Google, mostly — the right to 
monetize the products they spend billions of dollars at significant risk
 to develop; this was <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/ends-means-and-antitrust/">my chief objection to last year’s Google Shopping case</a>.
 In this case I narrowly come down on the Commission’s side almost by 
accident: I think Google acted illegally by contractually foreclosing 
Android competitors at a time when it might have made a difference, but I
 am concerned that the Commission’s publicly released reasoning doesn’t 
seem to grasp exactly how Android has developed, the choices Google 
made, and why.</p>
<p>That noted, I highly doubt Google would do anything differently: when
 it comes to the company’s goals, Android could not be a bigger success —
 if anything, this ruling is evidence of just how successful the product
 was.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-resigns-board-appoints-bob-swan-interim-ceo/">Brian Krzanich resigned as the CEO of Intel</a>
 after violating the company’s non-fraternization policy. The details of
 Krzanich’s departure, though, ultimately don’t matter: his tenure was 
an abject failure, the extent of which is only now coming into view.</p>
<h4>Intel’s Obsolete Opportunity</h4>
<p>When Krzanich was appointed CEO in 2013 it was already clear that 
arguably the most important company in Silicon Valley’s history was in 
trouble: PCs, long Intel’s chief money-maker, were in decline, leaving 
the company ever more reliant on the sale of high-end chips to data 
centers; Intel had effectively zero presence in mobile, the industry’s 
other major growth area.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-intel-opportunity/">I framed the situation that faced Krzanich as an opportunity</a>, and drew a comparison to the challenges that faced <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/andy-grove-and-the-iphone-se/">the legendary Andy Grove</a> three decades ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  By the 1980s, though, it was the microprocessor business, fueled by 
the IBM PC, that was driving growth, while the DRAM business was fully 
commoditized and dominated by Japanese manufacturers. Yet Intel still 
fashioned itself a memory company. That was their identity, come hell or
 high water.</p>
<p>  By 1986, said high water was rapidly threatening to drag Intel 
under. In fact, 1986 remains the only year in Intel’s history that they 
made a loss. Global overcapacity had caused DRAM prices to plummet, and 
Intel, rapidly becoming one of the smallest players in DRAM, felt the 
pain severely. It was in this climate of doom and gloom that Grove took 
over as CEO. And, in a highly emotional yet patently obvious decision, 
he once and for all got Intel out of the memory manufacturing business.</p>
<p>  Intel was already the best microprocessor design company in the world. They just needed to accept and embrace their destiny.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to the challenge that faced Krzanich:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is into a climate of doom and gloom that Krzanich is taking over as
 CEO. And, in what will be a highly emotional yet increasingly obvious 
decision, he ought to commit Intel to the chip manufacturing business, 
i.e. manufacturing chips according to other companies’ designs.</p>
<p>  Intel is already the best microprocessor manufacturing company in the world. They need to accept and embrace their destiny.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That article is now out of date: in a remarkable turn of events, 
Intel has lost its manufacturing lead. Ben Bajarin wrote last week in <a href="https://techpinions.com/intels-moment-of-truth/53135">Intel’s Moment of Truth</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Not only has the competition caught Intel they have surpassed them. 
TSMC is now sampling on 7nm and AMD will ship their architecture on 7nm 
technology in both servers and client PCs ahead of Intel. For those who 
know their history, this is the first time AMD has ever beat Intel to a 
process node. Not only that, but AMD will likely have at least an 18 
month lead on Intel with 7nm, and I view that as conservative.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As Bajarin notes, 7nm for TSMC (or Samsung or Global Foundries) isn’t
 necessarily better than Intel’s 10nm; chip-labeling isn’t what it used 
to be. The problem is that Intel’s 10nm process isn’t close to shipping 
at volume, and the competition’s 7nm processes are. Intel is behind, and
 its insistence on integration bears a large part of the blame.</p>
<h4>Intel’s Integrated Model</h4>
<p>Intel, like Microsoft, had its fortunes made by IBM: eager to get the
 PC an increasingly vocal section of its customer base demanded out the 
door, the mainframe maker outsourced much of the technology to third 
party vendors, the most important being an operating system from 
Microsoft and a processor from Intel. The impact of the former decision 
was the formation of an entire ecosystem centered around MS-DOS, and 
eventually Windows, cementing Microsoft’s dominance.</p>
<p>Intel was a slightly different story; while an operating system was 
simply bits on a disk, and thus easily duplicated for all of the PCs IBM
 would go on to sell, a processor was a physical device that needed to 
be manufactured. To that end IBM insisted on having a “second source”, 
that is, a second non-Intel manufacturer for Intel’s chips. Intel chose 
AMD, and licensed first the 8086 and 8088 designs that were in the 
original IBM PC, and later, again under pressure from IBM, the 80286 
design; the latter was particularly important because it was designed to
 be upward compatible with everything that followed.</p>
<p>This laid the groundwork for Intel’s strategy — and immense 
profitability — for the next 35 years. First off, the dominance of 
Intel’s x86 design was assured thanks to its integration with 
DOS/Windows: specifically, DOS/Windows created a two-sided market of 
developers and PC users, and DOS/Windows ran on x86.</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper.png" alt="Microsoft and Intel were integrated in the PC value chain" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3571" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.354-2-1024x699.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.354-2-300x205.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.354-2-768x525.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.354-2-922x630.png 922w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.354-2.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="437"></p>
<p>However, thanks to its licensing deal with AMD, Intel wasn’t 
automatically entitled to all of the profits that would result from that
 integration; thus Intel doubled-down on an integration of its own: the 
design and manufacture of x86 chips. That is, Intel would invest huge 
sums of money into creating new and faster designs (the 386, the 486, 
the Pentium, etc.), and also invest huge sums of money into ever smaller
 and more efficient manufacturing processes that would push the limits 
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>.
 This one-two punch would ensure that, despite AMD’s license, Intel’s 
chips would be the only realistic choice for PC makers, allowing the 
company to capture the vast majority of the profits created by the x86’s
 integration with DOS/Windows.</p>
<p>Intel was largely successful. AMD did take the performance crown 
around the turn of the century with the Athlon 64, but the company was 
unable to keep up with Intel financially when it came to fabs, and Intel
 illegally leveraged its dominant position with OEMs to keep them buying
 mostly Intel parts; then, a few years later, Intel not only took back 
the performance lead with its Core architecture, but settled into the 
“tick-tock” strategy where it alternated new designs and new 
manufacturing processes on a regular schedule. The integration advantage
 was real.</p>
<h4>TSMC’s Modular Approach</h4>
<p>In the meantime there was a revolution brewing in Taiwan. In 1987, 
Morris Chang founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 
promising “Integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust”. 
Integrity and customer trust referred to Chang’s commitment that TSMC 
would never compete with its customers with its own designs: the company
 would focus on nothing but manufacturing.</p>
<p>This was a completely novel idea: at that time all chip manufacturing
 was integrated a la Intel; the few firms that were only focused on chip
 design had to scrap for excess capacity at Integrated Device 
Manufacturers (IDMs) who were liable to steal designs and cut off 
production in favor of their own chips if demand rose. Now TSMC offered a
 much more attractive alternative, even if their manufacturing 
capabilities were behind.</p>
<p>In time, though, TSMC got better, in large part because it had no 
choice: soon its manufacturing capabilities were only one step behind 
industry standards, and within a decade had caught-up (although Intel 
remained ahead of everyone). Meanwhile, the fact that TSMC existed 
created the conditions for an explosion in “fabless” chip companies that
 focused on nothing but design. For example, in the late 1990s there was
 an explosion in companies focused on dedicated graphics chips: nearly 
all of them were manufactured by TSMC. And, all along, the increased 
business let TSMC invest even more in its manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper_002.png" alt="Integrated intel was competing with a competitive modular ecosystem" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3572" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-1024x679.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-300x199.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-768x509.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-950x630.png 950w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="424"></p>
<p>This represented into a three-pronged assault on Intel’s dominance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of those new fabless design companies were creating products 
that were direct alternatives to Intel chips for general purpose 
computing. The vast majority of these were based on the ARM 
architecture, but also AMD in 2008 spun off its fab operations 
(christened GlobalFoundries) and became a fabless designer of x86 chips.</li>
<li>Specialized chips, designed by fabless design companies, were 
increasingly used for operations that had previously been the domain of 
general purpose processors. Graphics chips in particular <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/apple-to-build-own-gpu-the-evolution-of-gpus-apple-and-the-general-purpose-gpu/">were well-suited to machine learning</a>,
 cryptocurrency mining, and other highly “embarrassingly parallel” 
operations; many of those applications have spawned specialized chips of
 their own. There are dedicated bitcoin chips, for example, or Google’s 
Tensor Processing Units: all are manufactured by TSMC.</li>
<li>Meanwhile TSMC, joined by competitors like GlobalFoundries and 
Samsung, were investing ever more in new manufacturing processes, fueled
 by the revenue from the previous two factors in a virtuous cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Intel’s Straitjacket</h4>
<p>Intel, meanwhile, was hemmed in by its integrated approach. The first major miss was mobile: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/andy-grove-and-the-iphone-se/">instead of simply manufacturing ARM chips for the iPhone</a>
 the company presumed it could win by leveraging its manufacturing to 
create a more-efficient x86 chip; it was a decision that evinced too 
much knowledge of Intel’s margins and not nearly enough reflection on 
the importance of the integration between DOS/Windows and x86.</p>
<p>Intel took the same mistaken approach to non general-purpose processors, particularly graphics: the company’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrabee_(microarchitecture)">Larrabee architecture</a>
 was a graphics chip based on — you guessed it — x86; it was predicated 
on leveraging Intel’s integration, instead of actually meeting a market 
need. Once the project predictably failed Intel limped along with 
graphics that were barely passable for general purpose displays, and 
worthless for all of the new use cases that were emerging.</p>
<p>The latest crisis, though, is in design: AMD is genuinely innovating 
with its Ryzen processors (manufactured by both GlobalFoundries and 
TSMC), while Intel is still selling varations on Skylake, a three 
year-old design. Ashraf Eassa, with assistance from a since-deleted 
tweet from a former Intel engineer, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/10/ex-intel-engineer-explains-the-companys-biggest-mi.aspx">explains what happened</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  According to a tweet from ex-Intel engineer Francois Piednoel, the 
company had the opportunity to bring all-new processor technology 
designs to its currently shipping 14nm technology, but management 
decided against it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
    my post was actually pointing out that market stalling is more 
troublesome than Ryzen, It is not a good news. 2 years ago, I said that 
ICL should be taken to 14nm++, everybody looked at me like I was the 
craziest guy on the block, it was just in case … well … now, they know</p>
<p>    — François Piednoël (@FPiednoel) <a href="https://twitter.com/FPiednoel/status/989617508289208320">April 26, 2018</a>
  </p></blockquote>
<p>  The problem in recent years is that Intel has been unable to bring 
its major new manufacturing technology, known as 10nm, into mass 
production. At the same time, the issues with 10nm seemed to catch Intel
 off-guard. So, by the time it became clear that 10nm wouldn’t go into 
production as planned, it was too late for Intel to do the work to bring
 one of the new processor designs that was originally developed to be 
built on the 10nm technology to its older 14nm technology…</p>
<p>  What Piednoel is saying in the tweet I quoted above is that when 
management had the opportunity to start doing the work to bring their 
latest processor design, known as Ice Lake (abbreviated “ICL” in the 
tweet), [to the 14nm process] they decided against doing so. That was 
likely because management truly believed two years ago that Intel’s 10nm
 manufacturing technology would be ready for production today. 
Management bet incorrectly, and Intel’s product portfolio is set to 
suffer as a result.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To put it another way, Intel’s management did not break out of the 
integration mindset: design and manufacturing were assumed to be in 
lockstep forever.</p>
<h4>Integration and Disruption</h4>
<p>It is perhaps simpler to say that Intel, like Microsoft, has been 
disrupted. The company’s integrated model resulted in incredible margins
 for years, and every time there was the possibility of a change in 
approach Intel’s executives chose to keep those margins. In fact, Intel 
has followed the script of the disrupted even more than Microsoft: while
 the decline of the PC finally led to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">The End of Windows</a>,
 Intel has spent the last several years propping up its earnings by 
focusing more and more on the high-end, selling Xeon processors to cloud
 providers. That approach was certainly good for quarterly earnings, but
 it meant the company was only deepening the hole it was in with regards
 to basically everything else. And now, most distressingly of all, the 
company looks to be on the verge of losing its performance advantage 
even in high-end applications.</p>
<p>This is all certainly on Krzanich, and his predecessor Paul Otellini.
 Then again, perhaps neither had a choice: what makes disruption so 
devastating is the fact that, absent a crisis, it is almost impossible 
to avoid. Managers are paid to leverage their advantages, not destroy 
them; to increase margins, not obliterate them. Culture more broadly is <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/">an organization’s greatest asset right up until it becomes a curse</a>.
 To demand that Intel apologize for its integrated model is satisfying 
in 2018, but all too dismissive of the 35 years of success and profits 
that preceded it.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The first thing to understand about the decision by a federal judge
 to approve AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Time Warner, over the objection of
 the U.S. Department of Justice, is that it is very much in-line with 
the status quo: this is a vertical merger, and both the Department of 
Justice and the courts have defaulted towards approving such mergers for
 decades.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_0_3563" data-footnote-number="3" data-footnote-identifier="3" alt="See Footnote 3" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the presumption that vertical mergers are not anti-competitive is a worthwhile, albeit separate, discussion &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_0_3563" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_0_3563" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_0_3563" id="identifier_0_3563" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Whether or not the presumption that vertical mergers are not anti-competitive is a worthwhile, albeit separate, discussion">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, that there is an explosion of merger activity in and between 
the television production and distribution space is hardly a surprise: 
the Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) business — that 
is, television distributed by cable, broadband, or satellite — has been 
shrinking for years now, and in a world where the addressable market is 
decreasing, the only avenues for growth are winning share from 
competitors, acquiring competitors, or vertically integrating.</p>
<p>Third, that last paragraph overstates the industry’s travails, at 
least in terms of television distribution, because most TV distributors 
are also internet service providers (ISPs), which means they are getting
 paid by consumers using the services disrupting MVPDs, including 
Netflix, Google, Facebook, and the Internet generally.</p>
<p>What was both unsurprising and yet odd about this case was the degree
 to which it was fought over point number two, with minimal 
acknowledgement of point number three. That is, it seems clear to me 
that AT&amp;T made this acquisition with an eye on point number three, 
yet the government’s case was predicated on point number two; to that 
end, the government, in my eyes, rightly lost given the case they made. 
Whether they should have lost a better case is another question 
entirely.</p>
<h4>Why AT&amp;T Bought Time Warner</h4>
<p>What is the point of a merger, instead of a contract? This is a 
question that always looms large in any acquisition, particularly one of
 this size: AT&amp;T is paying $85 billion for Time Warner, and that’s 
an awfully steep price to simply hang out with movie stars.</p>
<p>The standard explanation for most mergers is “synergies”, the idea 
that there are significant cost savings from combining the operations of
 two companies; the reason this explanation is popular is because saving
 money is not an issue for antitrust, while the corresponding 
possibility — charging higher prices by achieving a stronger market 
position through consolidation — is. Such an explanation, though, is 
usually applied in the case of a horizontal merger, not a vertical one 
like AT&amp;T and Time Warner.</p>
<p>To that end, AT&amp;T was remarkably honest in its <a href="http://about.att.com/story/att_to_acquire_time_warner.html">press release announcing the merger back in 2016</a>:<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_1_3563" data-footnote-number="4" data-footnote-identifier="4" alt="See Footnote 4" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the company also mentioned synergies, but it was hardly the point of the press release. &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_1_3563" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_1_3563" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_1_3563" id="identifier_1_3563" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To be fair, the company also mentioned synergies, but it was hardly the point of the press release.">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With great content, you can build truly differentiated video 
services, whether it’s traditional TV, OTT or mobile. Our TV, mobile and
 broadband distribution and direct customer relationships provide unique
 insights from which we can offer addressable advertising and better 
tailor content,” [AT&amp;T CEO Randall] Stephenson said. “It’s an 
integrated approach and we believe it’s the model that wins over time…</p>
<p>  AT&amp;T expects the deal to be accretive in the first year after 
close on both an adjusted EPS and free cash flow per share 
basis…Additionally, AT&amp;T expects the deal to improve its dividend 
coverage and enhance its revenue and earnings growth profile.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Start with the second point: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/att-to-buy-time-warner-pending-regulatory-approval-the-att-perspective-the-time-warner-perspective/">as I noted at the time</a>, it’s not very sexy, but it matters to AT&amp;T, a 34-year member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats">Dividend Aristocrats</a>,
 that is, a company in the S&amp;P 500 that raised its dividend for 25 
years straight or more. It’s a core part of AT&amp;T’s valuation, but 
the company’s free cash flow has been struggling to keep up with its 
rising dividends. Time Warner will help significantly in this regard, as
 did the previous acquisition of DirecTV.</p>
<p>It is the first point, though, that is pertinent to this analysis: 
how exactly might Time Warner allow AT&amp;T to “build truly 
differentiated video services”?</p>
<h4>The Government’s Case</h4>
<p>While the AT&amp;T press release noted that those “truly 
differentiated video services” could be delivered via traditional TV, 
OTT, or mobile, the government’s case was entirely concerned with 
traditional TV. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1012916/download">original complaint</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Were this merger allowed to proceed, the newly combined firm likely 
would — just as AT&amp;T/DirecTV has already predicted — use its control
 of Time Warner’s popular programming as a weapon to harm competition. 
AT&amp;T/DirecTV would hinder its rivals by forcing them to pay hundreds
 of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks, and it
 would use its increased power to slow the industry’s transition to new 
and exciting video distribution models that provide greater choice for 
consumers. The proposed merger would result in fewer innovative 
offerings and higher bills for American families.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea is that AT&amp;T could leverage its ownership of DirecTV to 
demand higher prices for Turner networks from other MVPDs, because if 
the MVPDs refused to pay customers would be driven to switch to 
DirectTV. The problem is that, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-department-of-justice-sues-to-block-the-att-time-warner-acquisition-the-dojs-case-atts-objections/">as was easily calculable</a>,
 this makes no economic sense: the amount of money AT&amp;T would lose 
by blacking out Turner would almost certainly outweigh whatever gains it
 might accrue. The judge agreed, and that was that.</p>
<h4>AT&amp;T’s Real Goals</h4>
<p>Remember, though, that AT&amp;T did not limit its options to 
traditional TV: what is far more compelling are the possibilities Time 
Warner content presents for OTT and mobile. The question is not what 
AT&amp;T can do to increase the revenue potential of Time Warner content
 (which was the government’s focus), but rather what Time Warner content
 can do to increase the potential of AT&amp;T’s services, particularly 
mobile.</p>
<p>Forgive the long excerpt, but I covered this angle at length <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/att-to-buy-time-warner-pending-regulatory-approval-the-att-perspective-the-time-warner-perspective/">in a Daily Update</a> when the deal was announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>AT&amp;T’s core wireless business is competing in a 
saturated market with few growth prospects. Apple’s gift to the wireless
 industry of customers demanding high-priced data plans has largely run 
its course, with AT&amp;T perhaps the biggest winner: the company 
acquired significant market share even as it increased its average 
revenue per user for nearly a decade, primarily thanks to the iPhone. 
Now, though, most everyone has a smartphone and, more pertinently, a 
data plan…</p>
<p>The implication of a saturated market is that growth is increasingly 
zero sum, which presents both a problem and an opportunity for AT&amp;T.
 The problem is primarily T-Mobile: fueled by the massive break-up fee 
paid by AT&amp;T for the aforementioned failed acquisition, T-Mobile has
 embarked on an all-out assault against the incumbent wireless carriers,
 and AT&amp;T has felt the pain the most, recording a negative net 
change in postpaid wireless customers for eight straight quarters. 
Unable or unwilling to compete with T-Mobile on price, AT&amp;T needs a 
differentiator, ideally one that will not only forestall losses but 
actually lead to gains.</p>
<p>At first glance this doesn’t explain the Time Warner acquisition 
either: per my point above these are two very different companies with 
two very different strategic views of content. A distributor in a 
zero-sum competition for subscribers (like AT&amp;T) has a vertical 
business model: ideally there should be services and content that are 
exclusive to the distributor, thus securing customers. Time Warner, 
though, is a content company, which means it has a horizontal business 
model: content is made once and then monetized across the broadest set 
of potential customers possible, taking advantage of content’s zero 
marginal cost. The assumption of this sort of horizontal business model 
underlay Time Warner’s valuation; to suddenly make Time Warner’s content
 exclusive to AT&amp;T would be massively value destructive (this is a 
reality often missed by suggestions that Apple, for example, should 
acquire content companies to differentiate its hardware).</p>
<p>AT&amp;T, however, may have found a loophole: zero rating. Zero 
rating is often conflated with net neutrality, but unlike the latter, 
zero rating does not entail the discriminatory treatment of data; it 
just means that some data is free (sure, this is a violation of the <em>idea</em> of net neutrality, but this is why <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/daily-update-watch-net-neutrality-zero-rating/">I was critical</a> of the narrow focus on discriminatory treatment of data by net neutrality advocates). AT&amp;T is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/att-owner-of-directv-exempts-directv-from-mobile-data-caps/">already using zero rating to push DirecTV</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><iframe src="stratechery.com_files/l2MYgAaPVDQ.html" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>This is almost certainly the plan for Time Warner content as well: 
sure, it will continue to be available on all distributors, but if you 
subscribe to AT&amp;T you can watch as much as you want for free; 
moreover, this offering is one that is strengthened by secular trends 
towards cord-cutting and mobile-only video consumption. If those trends 
continue on their current path AT&amp;T will not only strengthen the 
moat of its wireless service against T-Mobile but maybe even start to 
steal share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this point never came up in the government’s case, and, by extension, the judge’s ruling, is truly astounding.</p>
<p>That noted, it is very fair to wonder why exactly the Department of 
Justice sued to block this acquisition: President Trump was very 
outspoken in his opposition to this deal and even more outspoken in his 
antipathy towards Time Warner-owned CNN. At the same time, Makan 
Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust who led the case,
 <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/no-big-worries-in-at-t-deal-for-time-warner~978794">didn’t see a problem with the merger</a>
 before his appointment. That the government’s complaint rested on both 
the most obvious angle and, from AT&amp;T’s perspective, the least 
important, suggests a paucity of rigor in the prosecution of this case; 
it is very reasonable to wonder if the order to oppose the merger came 
from the top, and that the easiest case was the obvious out.</p>
<h4>The Neutrality Solution</h4>
<p>Thus we are in the unfortunate scenario where a bad case by the 
government has led to, at best, a merger that was never examined for its
 truly anti-competitive elements, and at worst, bad law that will open 
the door for similar tie-ups. To be sure, it is not at all clear that 
the government would have won had they focused on zero rating: there is 
an obvious consumer benefit to the concept — that is why T-Mobile 
leveraged it to such great effect! — and the burden would have been on 
the government to show that the harm was greater.</p>
<p>The bigger issue, though, is the degree to which laws surrounding such issues are woefully out-of-date. Last fall I argued that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/pro-neutrality-anti-title-ii/">Title II was the wrong framework to enforce net neutrality</a>, even though net neutrality is <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/netflix-net-neutrality/">a concept I absolutely support</a>; I came to that position in part because zero rating was barely covered by the FCC’s action.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_2_3563" data-footnote-number="5" data-footnote-identifier="5" alt="See Footnote 5" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;The FCC said it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf&quot;&gt;take it case-by-case&lt;/a&gt;, and did argue in the waning days of the Obama administration that zero rating one’s own services as AT&amp;T is clearly trying to do was a violation, but that was never tested in court and was quickly rolled back &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_2_3563" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_2_3563" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_2_3563" id="identifier_2_3563" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The FCC said it would take it case-by-case, and did argue in the waning days of the Obama administration that zero rating one’s own services as AT&amp;T is clearly trying to do was a violation, but that was never tested in court and was quickly rolled back">3</a></sup></p>
<p>What is clearly needed is new legislation, not an attempt to misapply
 ancient regulation in a way that is trivially reversible. Moreover, 
AT&amp;T has a point that online services like Google and Facebook are 
legitimate competitors, particularly for ad dollars; said regulation 
should address the entire sector. To that end I would focus on three key
 principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ISPs should not purposely slow or block data on a 
discriminatory basis. I am not necessarily opposed to the concept of 
“fast lanes”, as I believe that offers significant potential for 
innovative services, although I recognize the arguments against them; it
 should be non-negotiable, though, that ISPs cannot purposely disfavor 
certain types of content.</li>
<li>Second, and similarly, dominant internet platforms should not be 
allowed to block any legal content from their services. At the same 
time, services should have discretion in monetization and algorithms; 
that anyone should be able to put content on YouTube, for example, does 
not mean that one has a right to have Google monetize it on their 
behalf, or surface it to people not looking for it.</li>
<li>Third, ISPs should not be allowed to zero-rate their own content, 
and platforms should not be allowed to prioritize their own content in 
their algorithms. Granted, this may be a bit extreme; at a minimum there
 should be strict rules and transparency around transfer pricing and a 
guarantee that the same rates are allowed to competitive services and 
content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reality of the Internet, as noted by <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>,
 is increased centralization; meanwhile, the impact on the Internet on 
traditional media is an inexorable drive towards consolidation. Our 
current laws and antitrust jurisprudence are woefully unprepared to deal
 with this reality, and a new law guaranteeing neutrality is the best 
solution.</p>

<p>For me the circumstances were a trip to San Francisco; I purposely 
stayed at a hotel relatively far from where most of my meetings were, 
giving me no choice but to rely on some combination of scooters, 
e-bikes, and ride-sharing services. The scooters were a clear winner: 
fast, fun, and convenient — as long as you could find one near you. The 
city needs five times as many.</p>
<p>So, naturally, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Bye-bye-SF-scooters-as-Bird-Lime-and-Spin-go-on-12966874.php">San Francisco banned them</a>,
 at least temporarily: companies will be able to apply for their share 
of a pool of a mere 1,250 permits; that number may double in six months,
 but for now the scooter-riding experience will probably be more of a 
novelty, not something you can rely on. In fact, by the end of my trip, 
if I were actually in a rush, I knew to use a ride-sharing service.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that ride-sharing services have higher liquidity: 
San Francisco is a car-friendly town. The city has a population of 
884,363 humans and 496,843 <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/add5eb07-c676-40b4-98b5-8011b059260a/est_fees_pd_by_county.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">vehicles</a>, mostly in the city’s 275,000 <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/press-releases/sfmta-completes-citywide-census-street-parking-spaces">on-street parking spaces</a>. Granted, most of the Uber and Lyft drivers come from outside the city, but there is no congestion tax to deter them.</p>
<p>The result is an urban area stuck on a bizarre local maxima: most 
households have cars, but rarely use them, particularly in the city, 
because traffic is bad and parking is — relative to the number of cars —
 sparse; the alternative is ride-sharing, which incurs the same traffic 
costs but at least doesn’t require parking. And yet, San Francisco, for 
now anyways, will only allow about 60 parking spaces-worth of scooters 
onto the streets.</p>
<h4>Everything as a Service</h4>
<p>This is hardly the forum to discuss the oft-head-scratching politics 
of tech’s de facto capital city, and I can certainly see the downside of
 scooters, particularly the haphazard way with which they are being 
deployed; in an environment built for cars scooters get in the way.</p>
<p>It’s worth considering, though, just how much sense dockless scooters
 make: the concept is one of the purest manifestations of what I 
referred to in 2016 as <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">Everything as a Service</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What happens, though, if we apply the services business model to 
hardware? Consider an airplane: I fly thousands of miles a year, but 
while Stratechery is doing well, I certainly don’t own my own plane! 
Rather, I fly on an airplane that is owned by an airline that is paid 
for in part through some percentage of my ticket cost. I am, 
effectively, “renting” a seat on that airplane, and once that flight is 
gone I own nothing other than new GPS coordinates on my phone.</p>
<p>  Now the process of buying an airplane ticket, identifying who I am,
 etc. is far more cumbersome than simply hopping in my car — there are 
significant transaction costs — but given that I can’t afford an 
airplane it’s worth putting up with when I have to travel long 
distances. What happens, though, when those transaction costs are 
removed? Well, then you get Uber or its competitors: simply touch a 
button and a car that would have otherwise been unused will pick you up 
and take you where you want to go, for a price that is a tiny fraction 
of what the car cost to buy in the first place. The same model applies 
to hotels — instead of buying a house in every city you visit, simply 
rent a room — and Airbnb has taken the concept to a new level by 
leveraging unused space.</p>
<p>  The enabling factor for both Uber and Airbnb applying a services 
business model to physical goods is your smartphone and the Internet: it
 enables distribution and transactions costs to be zero, making it 
infinitely more convenient to simply rent the physical goods you need 
instead of acquiring them outright.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What is striking about dockless scooters — at least when one is 
parked outside your door! — is that they make ride-sharing services feel
 like half-measures: why even wait five minutes, when you can just 
scan-and-go? Steve Jobs described computers as <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/">bicycles of the mind</a>; now that computers are smartphones and connected to the Internet they can conjure up the physical equivalent as well!</p>
<p>Indeed, the only thing that could make the experience better — for 
riders and for everyone else — would be dedicated lanes, like, for 
example, the 900 miles worth of parking spaces in San Francisco. To be 
sure, the city isn’t going to make the conversion overnight, or, given 
the degree to which San Francisco is in thrall to homeowners, probably 
ever, but that is particularly a shame in 2018: venture capitalists are 
willing to fund the entire thing, and I’m not entirely sure why.</p>
<h4>Missing Moats</h4>
<p>Late last month came word that Sequoia Capital was leading a $150 
million funding round for Bird, one of the electric scooter companies, 
valuing the company at $1 billion; a week later came reports that GV was
 leading a $250 million investment in rival Lime.</p>
<p>One of the interesting tidbits in <a href="https://www.axios.com/gv-lime-1528190376-f3c7e62e-64d8-4316-8342-03757e39cd6f.html">Axios’s reporting</a> on the latter was that each Lime scooter is used on average between 8 and 12 times a day; plugging that number into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business/">this very useful analysis of scooter-sharing unit costs</a>
 suggests that the economics of both startups are very strong (certainly
 the size of the investments — and the quality of the investors — 
suggests the same).</p>
<p>The key word in that sentence, though, is “both”: what, precisely, 
might make Bird and Lime, or any of their competitors, unique? Or, to 
put it in business parlance, where is the moat? This is where the 
comparison to ride-sharing services is particularly instructive; I 
explained <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/uber-fights/">back in 2014</a> why there was more of a moat to be had in ride-sharing than most people thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a two-sided network between drivers and riders</li>
<li>As one service gains share, its increased utility of drivers will 
restrict liquidity on the other service, favoring the larger player</li>
<li>Riders will, all things being equal, use one service habitually</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to winner-take-all dynamics in a particular geographic 
area; then, when it comes times to launch in new areas, travelers and 
brand will give the larger service a head start.</p>
<p>To be sure, these interactions are complicated, and not everything is
 equal (see, for example, the huge amounts of share Lyft took last year 
thanks to Uber’s self-inflicted crises). It is that complication, 
though, and the fact it is exponentially more difficult to build a 
two-sided network (instead of, say, plopping a bunch of scooters on the 
street), that creates the conditions for a moat: the entire point of a 
moat is that it is hard to build.</p>
<h4>Uber’s Self-Driving Mistake</h4>
<p>This is why I have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/waymos-lawsuit-against-uber-existential-logic-uber-and-googles-miscalculation/">long maintained</a> that the second-biggest mistake<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_2_3558" data-footnote-number="8" data-footnote-identifier="8" alt="See Footnote 8" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;The first was not buying Lyft &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_2_3558" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_2_3558" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_2_3558" id="identifier_2_3558" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The first was not buying Lyft">3</a></sup>
 former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick made was the company’s head-first 
plunge into self-driving cars. On a surface level, the logic is obvious:
 Uber’s biggest cost is the driver, which means getting rid of them is 
an easy route to profitability — or, should someone else deploy 
self-driving cars first, then Uber could be undercut in price.</p>
<p>The mistake in Kalanick’s thinking is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, up-and-until the point that self-driving cars are widely 
available — that is, not simply invented, but built-and-deployed at 
scale — Uber’s drivers are its biggest competitive advantage. Kalanick’s
 public statements on the matter hardly evinced understanding on this 
point.</li>
<li>Second, bringing self-driving cars to market would entail huge 
amounts of capital investment. For one, this means it would be unlikely 
that Google, a company that rushes to reassure investors when it loses 
tens of basis points in margin, would do so by itself, and for another, 
whatever companies did make such an investment would be highly 
incentivized to maximize utilization of said investment as soon as 
possible. That means plugging into the dominant 
transportation-as-a-service network, which means partnering with Uber.</li>
</ul>
<p>My contention is that Uber would have been best-served concentrating 
all of its resources on its driver-centric model, even as it built 
relationships with everyone in the self-driving space, positioning 
itself to be the best route to customers for whoever wins the 
self-driving technology battle.</p>
<h4>Uber’s Second Chance</h4>
<p>Interestingly, scooters and their closely-related cousin, e-bikes, 
may give Uber a second chance to get this right. Absent two-sided 
network effects, the potential moats for, well, self-riding scooters and
 e-bikes are relatively weak: proprietary technology is likely to 
provide short-lived advantages at best, and Bird and Lime have plenty of
 access to capital. Both are experimenting with “charging-sharing”, 
wherein they pay people to charge the scooters in their homes, but both 
augment that with their own contractors to both charge vehicles and move
 them to areas with high demand.</p>
<p>What remains under-appreciated is habit: your typical tech 
first-adopter may have no problem checking multiple apps to catch a 
quick ride, but I suspect most riders would prefer to use the same app 
they already have on their phone. To that end, there is certainly a 
strong impetus for Bird and Lime to spread to new cities, simply to get 
that first-app-installed advantage, but this is where Uber has the 
biggest advantage of all: the millions of people who already have the 
Uber app.</p>
<p>To that end, I thought <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/waymos-lawsuit-against-uber-existential-logic-uber-and-googles-miscalculation/">Uber’s acquisition of Jump Bikes</a>
 was a good idea, and scooters should be next (an acquisition of Bird or
 Lime may already be too pricey, but Jump has a strong technical team 
that should be able to get an Uber-equivalent out the door soon). The 
Uber app already handles multiple kinds of rides; it is a small step to 
handling multiple kinds of transportation — a smaller step than 
installing yet another app.</p>
<h4>More Tech Surplus</h4>
<p>More generally, in a world where everything is a service, companies 
may have to adapt to shallower moats than they may like. If you squint, 
what I am recommending for Uber looks a bit like a traditional consumer 
packaged goods (CPG) strategy: control distribution (shelf-space | 
screen-space) with a few dominant products (e.g. TIDE | UberX) that 
provide leverage for new offerings (e.g. Swiffer | Jump Bikes). The 
model isn’t nearly as strong, but there may be other potential lock-ins,
 particularly in terms of exclusive contracts with cities and 
universities.</p>
<p>Still, that is hardly the sort of dominance that accrues to 
digital-only aggregators like Facebook or Google, or even Netflix; the 
physical world is much harder to monopolize. That everything will be 
available as a service means a massive increase in efficiency for 
society broadly — more products will be available to more people for 
lower overall costs — even as the difficulty in digging moats means most
 of that efficiency becomes consumer surplus. And, as long as venture 
capitalists are willing to foot the bill, cities like San Francisco 
should take advantage.</p>

		<p>Yesterday saw three developer-related announcements, two from 
Apple, and one from Microsoft. The former came as part of Apple’s annual
 Worldwide Developers Conference <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2018/">keynote</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The iOS App Store, which turns 10 next month, serves 500 million 
weekly visitors, and as of later this week will have earned developers 
over $100 billion.</li>
<li>Sometime next year developers will be able to write apps for the Mac using iOS user interface frameworks (known as UIKit).</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, for <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/microsoft-and-apple-double-down/">the second time in three years</a>, outshone Apple’s keynote with a massive acquisition. From <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/">the company’s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Microsoft Corp. on Monday announced it has reached an agreement to 
acquire GitHub, the world’s leading software development platform where 
more than 28 million developers learn, share and collaborate to create 
the future. Together, the two companies will empower developers to 
achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate 
enterprise use of GitHub, and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and 
services to new audiences.</p>
<p>  “Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with
 GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and 
innovation,” said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. “We recognize the 
community responsibility we take on with this agreement and will do our 
best work to empower every developer to build, innovate and solve the 
world’s most pressing challenges.”</p>
<p>  Under the terms of the agreement, Microsoft will acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion in Microsoft stock.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Developers can be quite expensive indeed!</p>
<h4>Platform-Developer Symbiosis</h4>
<p>Over the last few weeks, particularly in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">The Bill Gates Line</a>,
 I have been exploring the differences between aggregators and 
platforms; while aggregators generally harvest already produced content 
or goods, developers leverage the platform to create something entirely 
new.</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-7.png" alt="Platforms facilitate while aggregators intermediate" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3544" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-7.11.46-PM-1024x452.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-7.11.46-PM-300x132.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-7.11.46-PM-768x339.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-7.11.46-PM-1200x530.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="283"></p>
<p>This results in a symbiosis between developers and platforms: from a 
technical perspective, platforms provide the fundamental building blocks
 (i.e. application program interfaces, or APIs) necessary for developers
 to build new experiences, and from a marketing perspective, those new 
experiences give customers a reason to buy the platform in the first 
place, or to upgrade.</p>
<p>The degree to which applications drive adoption of the underlying 
platform can, of course, vary; unsurprisingly the monetization potential
 of the platform relative to developers varies in a correlated way. 
Traditional Windows, for example, provided very little end user 
functionality; what made it so valuable were all of the applications 
built on top of its open platform.</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper_004.png" alt="Windows was an open platform" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3546" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-2-1024x534.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-2-300x156.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-2-768x401.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-2-1200x626.png 1200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-2.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="334"></p>
<p>Here “open” means two things: first, the Windows API was available to
 anyone to build on, and two, developers built relationships directly 
with end users, including payment. This led to many huge software 
companies and, in 2003, to the creation of a platform on top of Windows:
 Valve’s Steam.</p>
<p>What Valve realized is that playing a game is only one part of the 
overall customer experience; the experience of discovering and buying 
the game matters as well, as does the installation and upgrade process. 
Moreover, these customer pain points were developer pain points as well;
 the original impetus to develop Steam, for example, was the difficulty 
in getting players to upgrade en masse, something that was essential for
 games in which players competed online. And, while Valve is a private 
company and has never announced Steam’s revenue numbers, reports suggest
 the platform generates <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-revenue-2017">billions of dollars a year</a>.</p>
<p>Even that, though, pales in comparison to the iOS App Store: Apple 
took Steam’s app store idea and integrated it with the platform, such 
that iOS users and developers had no choice but to use Apple’s 
owned-and-operated distribution channel, with all of the various 
limitations and costs — 30%, to be precise — that that entailed.</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper_007.png" alt="The iPhone platform with an intermediation layer" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3545" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1024x534.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-300x156.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-768x401.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1200x626.png 1200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="334"></p>
<p>Apple was able to accomplish this first and foremost because the underlying products — the iPhone and iPad — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">inspired demand in their own right</a>, independent of applications. Apple had the users that developers needed to make money.</p>
<p>Second, the App Store, like Steam before it, really was a better 
experience that drove more downloads and purchases by end users. This 
meant that developing for iOS wasn’t simply attractive because of the 
number of users, but also because those users were willing to buy more 
than they would have on another platform.</p>
<p>Third — and this applies to Steam as well — the App Store <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/friction/">dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for developers</a>;
 this led to more apps, which attracted more users, which led to more 
apps, both locking in apps as a competitive advantage and also ensuring 
that no one app had outsized power (leaving Apple free to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392470/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app-store-ios-game-steaming">restrict Steam-like competitors by fiat</a>).</p>
<h4>Apple’s Platform Announcements</h4>
<p>This frames the two Apple announcements I noted above. Start with the
 news of $100 billion for iOS developers: that means that Apple has 
collected around $40 billion, and at a very high margin to boot.</p>
<p>Moreover, the vast majority of Apple’s announcements were, if 
anything, about competing with those developers: the first new app 
announced, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/04/apple-ar-measuring-app/">Measure</a>,
 should immediately wipe out the only obviously useful Augmented Reality
 apps in the store. Apple also announced a new Podcasts app for Watch, 
update News, Stocks, and Voice Memo apps, and the only third party demos
 were about how one of the largest software companies there is 
—&nbsp;Adobe — would be supporting Apple’s preferred 3D-image format. 
And why not! The implication of owning all of those high-value users is 
that, on iOS anyways, developers are cheap.</p>
<p>The Mac, though, is a different story: the platform is far smaller 
than the iPhone; that there remain a number of high quality independent 
software vendors supporting the Mac is a testament to how valuable it is
 for developers to be able to build direct relationships with customers 
that can span years and multiple transactions. Still, there seems little
 question that the number of Mac apps is, if not trending in the wrong 
direction, certainly not growing in any meaningful way; there simply 
aren’t enough users to entice developers.</p>
<p>That means Apple’s approach has to be very different from iOS: 
instead of dictating terms to developers, Apple announced that it is in 
the middle of a multi-year project to make it easier to port iOS apps to
 the Mac. This is, in a fashion, Apple paying for Mac apps; no, the 
money isn’t going to developers, but Apple is voluntarily taking on a 
much greater portion of the porting workload. Developers are much more 
expensive when you don’t have nearly as many users.</p>
<h4>The Cost of GitHub</h4>
<p>Still, whatever it is costing Apple to build this porting framework, 
it surely is a lot less than $7.5 billion, the price Microsoft is paying
 for GitHub. Then again, at first glance, it may not be clear what the 
point of comparison is.</p>
<p>Go back to Windows: Microsoft had to do very little to convince 
developers to build on the platform. Indeed, even at the height of 
Microsoft’s antitrust troubles, developers continued to favor the 
platform by an overwhelming margin, for an obvious reason: that was 
where all the users were. In other words, for Windows, developers were 
cheap.</p>
<p>That is no longer the case today: Windows remains an important 
platform in the enterprise and for gaming (although Steam, much to 
Microsoft’s chagrin, takes a good amount of the platform profit there), 
but the company has no platform presence in mobile, and is in second 
place in the cloud. Moreover, that second place is largely predicated on
 shepherding existing corporate customers to cloud computing; it is not 
clear why any new company — or developer — would choose Microsoft.</p>
<p>This is the context for thinking about the acquisition of GitHub: 
lacking a platform with sufficient users to attract developers, 
Microsoft has to “acquire” developers directly through superior tooling 
and now, with GitHub, a superior cloud offering with a meaningful amount
 of network effects. The problem is that acquiring developers in this 
way, without the leverage of users, is extraordinarily expensive; it is 
very hard to imagine GitHub ever generating the sort of revenue that 
justifies this purchase price.</p>
<p>Again, though, GitHub revenue is not the point; Microsoft has plenty 
of revenue. What it also has is a potentially fatal weakness: no 
platform with user-based leverage. Instead Microsoft is betting that a 
future of open-source, cloud-based applications that exist independent 
of platforms will be a large-and-increasing share of the future, and 
that there is room in that future for a company to win by offering a 
superior user experience for developers directly, not simply exerting 
leverage on them.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is precisely why Microsoft is the best possible 
acquirer for GitHub, a company that, having raised $350 million in 
venture capital, was possibly not going to make it as an independent 
entity. Any company with a platform with a meaningful amount of users 
would find it very hard to resist the temptation to use GitHub as 
leverage; on the other side of the spectrum, purely enterprise-focused 
companies like IBM or Oracle would be tempted to wring every possible 
bit of profit out of the company.</p>
<p>What Microsoft wants is much fuzzier: it wants to be developers’ 
friend, in large part because it has no other option. In the long run, 
particularly as <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">Windows continues to fade</a>,
 the company will be ever more invested in a world with no gatekeepers, 
where developer tools and clouds win by being better on the merits, not 
by being able to leverage users.</p>
<p>That, though, is exactly why Microsoft had to pay so much: buying in 
directly is a whole lot more expensive than using leverage, which can 
produce equivalent — or better! — returns for much less investment.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Two of the more famous military sayings are “Generals are always 
preparing to fight the last war”, and “Never interrupt your enemy while 
he is making a mistake.” I thought of the latter at the conclusion of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-google-get-so-big/">last Sunday’s 60 Minutes report on Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Google declined our request for an interview with one of its 
executives for this story, but in a written response to our questions, 
the company denied it was a monopoly in search or search advertising, 
citing many competitors including Amazon and Facebook. It says it does 
not make changes to its algorithm to disadvantage competitors and that, 
“our responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our 
users, not specific placements for sites within our results. We 
understand that those sites whose ranking falls will be unhappy and may 
complain publicly.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The 60 Minutes report was not exactly fair-and-balanced; it featured an anti-tech-monopoly crusader<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_0_3501" data-footnote-number="9" data-footnote-identifier="9" alt="See Footnote 9" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;I’ve discussed why I disagree with Gary Reback’s views on monopoly and innovation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/more-on-chrome-and-amp-the-case-against-google-chris-dixon-on-decentralization/&quot;&gt;this Daily Update&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_0_3501" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_0_3501" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_0_3501" id="identifier_0_3501" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I’ve discussed why I disagree with Gary Reback’s views on monopoly and innovation in this Daily Update ">1</a></sup>, an <a href="http://www.jontaplin.com/">anti-tech-monopoly activist</a>, an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/vestager_en">anti-tech-monopoly regulator</a>, and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. And, in what seems highly unlikely to have been a coincidence, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42ac9192-5dd2-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68">Yelp this week filed a new antitrust complaint in the EU</a> against Google. To be sure, just because a report was biased does not mean it was wrong; while <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/ends-means-and-antitrust/">I am a bit skeptical of the EU’s antitrust case against Google Shopping</a>, the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/google-accused-anti-trust-violations-now-google-danger-unicorns/">open case about Android</a> seems pretty clear-cut. Neither, though, is Yelp’s direct concern.</p>
<h4>Yelp’s Case Against Google</h4>
<p>This is from a <a href="https://www.yelpblog.com/2018/05/cbs-60-minutes-piece-on-googles-abuse-of-dominance">blog post about the 60 Minutes feature</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yelp did participate in the piece because Google is doing
 the opposite of “delivering the best results possible,” and instead is 
giving its own content an unlawful advantage. We’ve made a video to 
explain exactly how Google puts its own interests ahead of consumers in 
local search, which you can watch here:</p>
<div align="center"><iframe src="stratechery.com_files/k9UqqmIJW4g.html" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Yelp’s position, at least in this video, appears to be that Google’s 
answer box is anticompetitive because it only includes reviews and 
ratings from Google; presumably the situation could be resolved were 
Google to use sources like Yelp. There are three problems with this 
argument, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the answer box originally included content scraped from sources like Yelp and other vertical search sites; under <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/295971/130103googlesearchstmtofcomm.pdf">pressure from the FTC</a>, driven in part by complaints from Yelp and other vertical search engines, Google agreed to stop doing so in 2013.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_1_3501" data-footnote-number="10" data-footnote-identifier="10" alt="See Footnote 10" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;With regard to that FTC decision, yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274&quot;&gt;as the Wall Street Journal reported&lt;/a&gt;, some FTC staff members recommended suing Google; what is not true is that the recommendation was unanimous, or that FTC commissioners ultimately deciding to go in another direction was unusual. In fact, other staff groups in other groups recommended against the suit, and the decision of the FTC commissioners was unanimous. Again, that is not to say it was the right decision, but that the popular conception — including what was reported in that 60 Minutes piece — is a bit off &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_1_3501" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_1_3501" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_1_3501" id="identifier_1_3501" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="With regard to that FTC decision, yes, as the Wall Street Journal reported, some FTC staff members recommended suing Google; what is not true is that the recommendation was unanimous, or that FTC commissioners ultimately deciding to go in another direction was unusual.

<li>Second, in a telling testament to the power of being on top of 
search results, Google’s ratings and reviews have improved considerably 
in the two years since that video was posted; this isn’t a static market
 (to be sure, this is an argument that could be used on both sides).</li>
<li>Third — and this is the point of this article — what Yelp seems to want will only serve to make Google stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p>No wonder Google declined the request for an interview.</p>
<h4>The Bill Gates Line</h4>
<p>Over the last few weeks I have been exploring what differences there 
are between platforms and aggregators, and was reminded of this anecdote
 from Chamath Palihapitiya in <a href="http://haystack.vc/2015/09/17/transcript-chamath-at-strictlyvcs-insider-series/">an interview with Semil Shah</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Semil Shah:</strong> Do you see any similarities from your 
time at Facebook with Facebook platform and connect, and how Uber may 
supercharge their platform?</p>
<p>  <strong>Chamath:</strong> Neither of them are platforms. They’re 
both kind of like these comical endeavors that do you as an Nth 
priority. I was in charge of Facebook Platform. We trumpeted it out like
 it was some hot shit big deal. And I remember when we raised money from
 Bill Gates, 3 or 4 months after — like our funding history was $5M, $83
 M, $500M, and then $15B. When that 15B happened a few months after 
Facebook Platform and Gates said something along the lines of, “That’s a
 crock of shit. This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic 
value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that 
creates it. Then it’s a platform.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>By this measure Windows was indeed the ultimate platform — the 
company used to brag about only capturing a minority of the total value 
of the Windows ecosystem — and the operating system’s clear successors 
are Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s own Azure Cloud Services. In all
 three cases there are strong and durable businesses to be built on top.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3468" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper_005.png" alt="A drawing of Platform Businesses Attract Customers by Third Parties" class="size-large wp-image-3468" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-1024x552.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-300x162.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-768x414.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-1168x630.png 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="345"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/">Tech’s Two Philosophies</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once a platform dips under the Bill Gates Line, though, the long-term
 potential of a business built on a “platform” starts to decline. 
Apple’s App Store, for example, has all of the trappings of a platform, 
but Apple quite clearly captures the vast majority of the overall 
ecosystem, both because of the profitability of the iPhone and also 
because of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/">its control of App Store economics</a>; the paucity of strong and durable businesses on the App Store is a natural outgrowth of that.</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper_003.png" alt="The App Store intermediates 3rd parties and users" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3504" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-1024x542.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-300x159.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-768x406.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.351-1-1190x630.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="339"></p>
<p>Note that Apple’s ability to control the economics of its developers 
comes from intermediating the relationship of those developers with 
customers.</p>
<h4>Aggregators, Not Platforms</h4>
<p>Facebook and Google take this intermediation to the extreme, 
leveraging their ability to drive discovery of the sheer abundance of 
information on their network and the Internet broadly:</p>
<figure id="attachment_3467" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper_006.png" alt="A drawing of Aggregators Own Customer Relationships and Suppliers Follow" class="size-large wp-image-3467" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.251-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.251-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.251-768x576.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.251-840x630.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="480"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">In the aggregator business model the aggregator owns customers and suppliers follow</figcaption></figure>
<p>It follows that Facebook and Google’s “platforms” not only don’t meet
 the Bill Gates Line, they don’t even register on the graph: they are 
the purest expression of aggregators. From my <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">original formulation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn this 
dynamic on its head. First, the Internet has made distribution (of 
digital goods) free, neutralizing the advantage that pre-Internet 
distributors leveraged to integrate with suppliers. Secondly, the 
Internet has made transaction costs zero, making it viable for a 
distributor to integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.</p>
<p>  This has fundamentally changed the plane of competition: no longer 
do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, 
with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be 
aggregated at scale leaving consumers/users as a first order priority. 
By extension, this means that the most important factor determining 
success is the user experience: the best 
distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best 
experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts 
the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous 
cycle.</p>
<p>  The result is the shift in value predicted by the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/">Conservation of Attractive Profits</a>.
 Previous incumbents, such as newspapers, book publishers, networks, 
taxi companies, and hoteliers, all of whom integrated backwards, lose 
value in favor of aggregators who aggregate modularized suppliers — 
which they often don’t pay for — to consumers/users with whom they have 
an exclusive relationship at scale.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms and aggregators: platforms are powerful because they <em>facilitate</em> a relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; aggregators, on the other hand, intermediate and control it.</p>
<p>Moreover, at least in the case of Facebook and Google, the point of integration in their respective value chains <em>is the network effect</em>. This is what I was trying to get at last week in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-moat-map/">The Moat Map</a> with my discussion of the internalization of network effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google has had the luxury of operating in an environment — the world
 wide web — that was by default completely open. That let the best 
technology win, and that win was augmented by the data that comes from 
serving an ever-increasing portion of the market. The end result was the
 integration of end users and the data feedback cycle that made Google 
search better and better the more it was used.</li>
<li>Facebook’s differentiator, meanwhile, is the relationships between 
friends and family; the company has subsequently integrated that network
 effect with consumer attention, forcing all of the content providers to
 jostle for space in the Newsfeed as pure commodities.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth noting, by the way, why it was that Facebook could come to
 be a rival to Google in the first place; specifically, Facebook <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/">had exclusive data</a>
 — those relationships and all of the behavior on Facebook’s site that 
resulted — that Google couldn’t get to. In other words, Facebook 
succeeded not by being a part of Google, but by being completely 
separate.</p>
<h4>Succeeding in a World of Aggregators</h4>
<p>This gets at why I find Yelp’s complaints a bit besides the point: 
the company seems to be expending an awful lot of energy to regain the 
right to give Google the content Yelp worked hard to acquire. There is 
revenue there, of course, just as there is in the production of 
commodities generally, but without a sustainable cost advantage it’s not
 the best route to building a strong and durable business.</p>
<p>Of course that is the bigger problem: I noted above that Google’s 
library of ratings and reviews has grown substantially over the past few
 years; users generating content are the ultimate low-cost supplier, and
 losing that supply to Google is arguably a bigger problem for Yelp than
 whatever advertising revenue it can wring out from people that would 
click through on a hypothetical Google Answer Box that used 3rd-party 
sources. And, it should be noted, that Yelp’s entire business is 
user-generated reviews: they and similar vertical sites are likely to do
 a far better job of generating, organizing, and curating such data.</p>
<p>Still, I can’t help but wonder whether or not Yelp’s problem is not 
that Google is using its own content in the Answer Box, but rather the 
Answer Box itself; which of these set of results would be better for 
Yelp’s business, even in a hypothetical world where Answer Box content 
comes from Yelp?</p>
<p><img src="stratechery.com_files/yelp-search-1024x749.jpg" alt="Yelp would get more visitors without the answer box" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3503" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/yelp-search-1024x749.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/yelp-search-300x219.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/yelp-search-768x562.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/yelp-search-861x630.jpg 861w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/yelp-search.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="468"></p>
<p>Presuming that the answer is the image on the right — driving users 
to Yelp is both better for the bottom line and better for content 
generation, which mostly happens on the desktop — and it becomes clear 
that Yelp’s biggest problem is that the more useful Google is — even if 
it only ever uses Yelp’s data! — the less viable Yelp’s business 
becomes. This is exactly what you would expect in an 
aggregator-dominated value chain: aggregators completely disintermediate
 suppliers and reduce them to commodities.</p>
<p>To that end, this is why the best strategies entail business models 
that avoid Google and Facebook completely: look no further than Amazon, 
which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-10/amazon-is-said-to-halt-google-shopping-ads-as-rivalry-heats-up">last month stopped buying Google Shopping ads</a>, something the company can afford to do given that <a href="https://www.survata.com/blog/amazon-takes-49-percent-of-consumers-first-product-search-but-search-engines-rebound/">half of shoppers start their product searches on Amazon</a>.
 To be sure, Amazon is plenty powerful in its own right, but it is a 
hard-to-ignore example of Google’s favorite argument that “competition 
is only a click away.”</p>
<h4>Yelp Versus Google</h4>
<p>Still, I have sympathy for Yelp’s position; Stoppelman told 60 Minutes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If I were starting out today, I would have no shot of building Yelp. 
That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their 
approach…because if you provide great content in one of these categories
 that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially threatening, they 
will snuff you out.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Stoppelman is right, but the reason is perhaps less nefarious than it
 seems; the 60 Minutes report explained why in the voiceover:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Yelp and countless other sites depend on Google to bring them web traffic — eyeballs for their advertisers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yelp, like many other review sites, has deep roots in SEO — 
search-engine optimization. Their entire business was long predicated on
 Google doing their customer acquisition for them. To the company’s 
credit it has become a well-known brand in its own right, and now gets 
around 70% of its visits via its mobile app. Those visits are very much 
in the Amazon model I highlighted above: users are going straight to 
Yelp and bypassing Google directly.</p>
<p>That, though, isn’t great for Google! It seems a bit rich that Yelp 
should be free to leverage its app to avoid Google completely, and yet 
demand that Google continue to feature Yelp prominently in its search 
results, particularly on mobile, where the Answer Box has particular 
utility. I get that Yelp feels like Google has changed the terms of the 
deal from when Yelp was founded in 2004, but the reality is that the 
change that truly mattered was mobile.</p>
<p>What I do find compelling is <a href="https://www.focusontheuser.com/">a new video</a>
 that Yelp put out yesterday; while it makes many of the same points as 
the one above, instead of being focused on regulators it is targeting 
Google itself, arguing that Google isn’t living up to its own standards 
by not featuring the best results, and not driving traffic back to sites
 that make the content Google needs (by, for example, not including 
prominent links to the content filling its answer boxes; Yelp isn’t 
asking that they go away, just that they drive traffic to 3rd parties). 
Google may be an aggregator, but it still needs supply, which means it 
needs a sustainable open web. The company should listen.</p>
<h4>Facebook and Data Portability</h4>
<p>Facebook, unfortunately for its suppliers, faces no such constraints:
 the content that is truly differentiated is made by Facebook’s users, 
and it is wholly owned by Facebook. Facebook is even further from the 
Bill Gates Line than Google is: the latter at least needs commoditized 
suppliers; the former can take or leave them on a whim, and does.</p>
<p>That is why I’ve come to realize a popular prescription for 
Facebook’s dominance, data portability, put forward this week by a 
coalition of progressive organizations under the umbrella <a href="https://freedomfromfb.com/">Freedom From Facebook</a>, is so mistaken.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_2_3501" data-footnote-number="11" data-footnote-identifier="11" alt="See Footnote 11" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;To be fair, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/manifestos-and-monopolies/&quot;&gt;I’ve made the same argument&lt;/a&gt; previously, but I’ve changed my mind &lt;/p&gt;"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" viewBox="0 0 6 6" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><circle r="3" cx="3" cy="3" fill="white"></circle></svg> </button></div><sup data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_2_3501" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_2_3501" class="footnote-print-only"><a href="#footnote_2_3501" id="identifier_2_3501" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To be fair, I’ve made the same argument previously, but I’ve changed my mind">3</a></sup>
 The problem with data portability is that it goes both ways: if you can
 take your data out of Facebook to other applications, you can do the 
same thing in the other direction. The question, then, is which entity 
is likely to have the greater center of gravity with regards to data: 
Facebook, with its social network, or practically anything else?</p>
<figure id="attachment_3130" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="stratechery.com_files/Paper.jpg" alt="Facebook at the center of data exchange" class="size-large wp-image-3130" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-1024x732.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-300x214.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-768x549.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-882x630.jpg 882w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" width="640" height="458"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/">The Facebook Brand</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Remember the conditions that led to Facebook’s rise in the first 
place: the company was able to circumvent Google, go directly to users, 
and build a walled garden of data that the search company couldn’t 
touch. Partnering or interoperating with companies below the Bill Gates 
Line, particularly aggregators, is simply an invitation to be 
intermediated. To demand that governments enforce exactly that would be a
 mistake that only helps Facebook.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button class="bigfoot-footnote__button" id="identifier_3_3501" data-footnote-number="12" data-footnote-identifier="12" alt="See Footnote 12" rel="footnote" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;The group’s demand that Facebook be forced to divest Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger makes much more sense in terms of this framework (with the exception of Messenger, which has always been a part of Facebook).

<hr>
<p>The broader takeaway is that distinguishing between platforms and 
aggregators isn’t simply an academic exercise: it should affect how 
companies think about their competitive environment vis-à-vis the 
biggest companies in tech, and, just as importantly, it should weigh 
heavily on regulators. The Microsoft antitrust battles of the 2000s were
 in many respects about enforcing interoperability as a way of breaking 
into the Microsoft platform; today antitrust should be far more 
concerned about aggregators capturing everything they touch by virtue of
 their control of end users.</p>
<p>That’s the thing about the “Generals fight the last war” saying; it’s
 usually applied to the losing side that made mistake after mistake 
while the victors leveraged the new world order.</p>
